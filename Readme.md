# Stock Analysis using VBA

## Overview of Project
  This project provides analyis for a group of stocks using VBA for Excel. In this analysis we compare daily volume and annual return statistics for the selected stocks.
### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to calculate total daily volume and annual return for a group of stocks for years 2017 and 2018.  We use daily trading data and select the particular stocks to calculate the total volume and return for the group of stocks. The project also includes runtime analysis of refactored VBA code.  We use runtime statistics to review the performance of our code.
