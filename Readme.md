### Analysis
This analysis focuses on the influence of the time of year that theater projects are launched.  The goal is to determine if the time of year influences the success of kickstarter campaigns for theater projects.  The report provides additional analysis for the plays category with the objective of determining the impact of goal amounts to the success of campaigns for plays.

### Analysis of 2017 Stock Data
The chart below shows successful and failed theater campaigns based on launch date.  We can see that successful campaigns peak in the month of May followed by the months of June and July.  The failed campaigns remain fairly consistant, varying between 31 and 52 for each month.  Although there are small spikes in the months of May and October, the failure rate is relatively consistent.  The differences in successful campaigns vary much more with a high of 111 successful campaigns in May and a low number, 37 in December.
